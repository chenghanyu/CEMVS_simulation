    "contents" : "Complex-Valued EM Variable Selection Algorithm \n================================================\n\nThe R scripts implement the complex-valued EM variable selection algorithm (C-EMVS) to reproduce Figure 9 and Figure 10 shown in Section 3.2 of the manuscript. Two different parts of programs are included. The folder **circularEMVS** contains R functions for the circular EMVS algorithm. The associated **circularEMVS_sim2.R** script runs the algorithm and reproduce the figures in the manuscript. The R script **EMVSmainfcn.R** includes the main circular EM algorithm and other functions that are used for analysis and picturing. The general non-circular EMVS functions are in the another folder **CVEMVS** which use the Rcpp package to embed C++ code into the R functions. The associated **CVEMVS_sim2.R** script runs the general non-circular algorithm and generates the activation and strengh maps from CV-fMRI data.  The two versions of code lead to the same result, showing that the circular EMVS is the special case of the non-circular EMVS when the relation parameter is zero. The programs also show how fast the C-EMVS can detect activations.\n\n\nNotations\n------------------------------------------------\nIn the manuscript, $\\gamma$ is used to denote the regression coefficients and $\\psi$ for the indicator variables. However, the code follow a convention that uses $\\beta$ to denote the coefficients and $\\gamma$ is for the indicator variables.\n\n\nData\n------------------------------------------------\nAll data sets and functions for data manipulation are in the folder **data**. The original simulated data set *GrandPrelimSimData.mat* is stored in .mat format. The data have tansformed into a text file and RData file that can be read and operated in R.\n\nFigures\n------------------------------------------------\nThe figures generated from **circularEMVS_sim2.R** are saved in the **figures** folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
